## Project 1
### Project 1 Research question
I am exploring the various legislations which constrain women in Africa in order to find out what the social/economic consequences are in order to visually explain the effect of gender specific social constraints on the economic development of women in Africa.

### Project 1 Description
- The data set that this project draws from includes data focusing on disparities between men and women from a societal point of view through legislative constraints and freedoms by country.
- I was drawn to the opportunity to explore the relationship between the inherent equality represeted through each country's legislation, and the economic status of women in that country. The economic status is illustrated using female GNI/capita.
- My hypothesis is that the more constraining a country's legislation is the lower the female GNI/capita will be.
- The visualization shows the general relationship between legislation and GNI, and an expanded view of the specific legislations in each country.

### Project 1 Methodology
- Sources include the dataset from 2.2, specifically the file containing data about institutions and the HDI breakdown which includes GNI information.

## Project 2
### Project 2 Research question
I would like to explore the relationship between social norms (specifically child marriage and partner violence) and the gender gap in order to examine whether these norms are significant contributing factors to gender inequality in select African countries. 

### Project 2 Description
- I hypothesize that countries which have a higher percentage of child marriage and partner violence will have a larger gender gap and /or a lower female HDI value.
- Child marriage is known to increase the chance of domestic violence in a relationship. Supportive attitudes towards partner violence such as wife-beating can be influenced by the perception that women or girls are socially lesser valued than men. Such norms are factors which can contribute to inequalities in the gender gap in countries where they are customary.
- The visualization will profile stats on child marriage, attitude on partner violence and female HDI by country, highlighting the relationship between the social norms and gender gap in each country.

### Project 2 Methodology
- Sources include the dataset from 2.2, specifically the child marriage data and the HDR spreadsheet containing HDI data.
- Data has also been sourced from UNICEF Data: Monitoring the Situation of Children and Women (http://data.unicef.org/child-protection/violent-unions.html#sthash.wYgsuPXR.dpuf)
